# Agent-based models
_ABM made in W4 of Social and Cultural Dynamics_

Two different agent-based models:
- A simple agent-based model of gender biases
- Agent-based model in which a group of agents has to solve a task, either as individual learners or as social learners. The social learners can use different learning strategies to learn from the other agents. The individual learners will explore the task environment on their own.
